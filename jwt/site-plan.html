        I hope you find exactly what you are looking for on this website. I hope you gain a new knowledge about how humankind is learning more each day about what is inside and outside our universe. Just 50 years ago, we would have never imagined sending a telescope around 2000 light-years (1 million miles) away from Earth. On April 12, 1961 the first human was successfully launched into space. Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin made one orbit around Earth on a flight that lasted 108 minutes. Almost a month later on May 5,1961 the first American Astronaut, Alan Shepard was launched into space on a suborbital flight which lasted 15 minutes and reached a height of 116 miles into the atmosphere. 8 years later on July 21, 1969 American astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Fast forward to 2021, 60 years after the first human entered outer space. The James Webb Telescope was launched on December 25, 2021 at 7:20 AM EST. Who knows what the next 60 years will hold in space exploration, but I am confident that it will be amazing.

      <h3>Why & How</h3>
      <p>
        This site is packed full of knowledge from personal experience researching the James Webb Telescope. The information includes how and why the James Webb Telescope was built, along with a website tracking the telescope in real time. All answers provided have been thoroughly researched and made sure of the accuracy for the readers of this website. I answer all questions to the best of my knowledge and the power of my research capabilities. New questions and new research will always be key in space exploration. As the world continues to gain knowledge and resources our questions will become more important. As long as we ask questions there will be answers. We have to keep the imagination we were born with. Our imagination will fuel us into the future. The future holds the key to our beginning and our everlasting eternity. Keep asking questions, keep researching, and keep imagining because one day you will treasure all the knowledge you gained through your efforts.
